# SwingCounties

Currently will not work by just opening index.html.
You have to go to the terminal and cd to project folder, then
run <python -m SimpleHTTPServer>

This will create a local python server so we can run it on our machines.
Will have to fix this later obviously, it's because of issues with permissions
in chrome with using the csv file.
